This project aims to create a framework for spigot plugin development to allow for much easier and faster
creation of new content by providing easy access to necessary, but often tedious, ugly or annoying parts of spigot
plugin development including but not limited to, command param validation, delegating to subcommands, access to other apis, registering of commands and listeners, creation of plugin.yml, etc...
